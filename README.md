# The repository is for coursework of the Machine Learning
Course from University of Washington
The python function served as a example of the machine learning algorithms and concepts.
The notebooks will hold analysis of real world data.

#Machine Learning Specialization
Specialization contains algorithms and example that perform simple data analysis.
Most of the analysis are done through ipython notebook through graphlab library for demonstration purpose.
