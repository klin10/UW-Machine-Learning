# The repository is created to demonstrate the coursework of the Machine Learning
course from University of Washington
The python function served as a example of the machine learning algorithms and concepts
The notebooks will hold analysis of real life data

#Machine Learning Specialization
The repository contain algorithms and example that perform simple data analysis.
Most of the analysis are done through ipython notebook through graphlab library for demonstration purpose.
